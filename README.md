# Design-of-CMOS-based-high-gain-low-power-amplifier-circuit-for-the-amplification-of-bio-signals(viz., ECG, EEG, EHG, etc.) for

various health monitoring applications.
A biomedical device consists of different kinds of transducers, amplifiers, and signal processing
instruments. Bio signals collected from the human body are characterized by very low
amplitudes. Therefore, amplifiers play a vital role in the signal processing and utilization of these
signals. To this end, complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology has been
the most dominant building block in the field of the semiconductor industry which is responsible
for producing a wide variety of chips, including those used in biomedical applications. The
Miniaturization of Electronic Equipment in a wearable sensor is quite famous nowadays.
Reducing the size of sensors and devices and putting them on one Integrated Circuit is the idea.
This Project aims to design a CMOS based high gain, low power amplifier circuit for the
amplification of bio-signals. The goal of the amplifier design is to focus on requiring a small
amount of power, while allowing for high gain so that it could be integrated into an efficient
wearable bio-signal collection device. The proposed amplifier utilizes a 4-CMOS current mirror
to act as a current source for the folded-cascade amplifier comprised of CMOS. The output of the
folded-cascade amplifier is then fed through a DC filtering capacitor as input to an additional
differential gain stage comprised of CMOS. For medical diagnosis and physiological
monitoring, low power and high gain are very important for bio signal amplification. For
biomedical sensing high gain is needed to sense the biomedical signals.
